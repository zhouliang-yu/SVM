## **SVM Programming Report**
In this assignment we implemant various settings of support vector machine, including the regular linear SVM, SVM with slack variable, SVM with kernels.

## **SVM Formulation**
The objective function of support vector machine is:

$$
min_{w, b} \frac{1}{2}||w||^{2} \\
s.t. y_{i}(w^{T}x_{i} + b) \ge 1 \forall i
$$

## **Regular SVM**
So in our project we use the "w" to denote the weight, "b" to denote the bias, and x_{i} to denote training data, y_{i} to denote the training label.

So in regular SVM we set the slack variable to be a relatively very small number, and set the kernel to be linear.
```python
clf = svm.SVC(C=1e5, kernel = 'linear')
```
then we can get the following output to notice that class 0  "Iris-setosa" is linear separable

By training the regular SVM by the setting mentioned above we can get the following result:
```
training_error:0.016667

w_of_setosa:-0.046258538085542256, 0.5211827995531007, -1.0030446153124941, -0.4641297849669344,

## **SVM with Slack Formulation**

A SVM with slack variable look like this, we allow little portion of data not in the decision region.
![](https://i.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/03/8f90471dd8899712.png)

So the optimization problem formulation look like this:
![](https://i.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/03/6c86c08324f36146.png)
we can then derive its dual lagurangian and dual problem 
![](https://i.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/03/0988594784420a24.png)

the solution $\alpha_{i}$ has the following 3 cases:
1. $\alpha_{i} = 0$ the corresponding data are correctly classified and doesn’t contribute to the classifier, locating outside of the margin
2. 0 < αi < C: in this case, µi > 0 due to αi = C − µi
; Since µiξi = 0,
then we have ξi = 0. The corresponding data are correctly classified and
contributes to the classifier, locating on the margin
3. αi = C: in this case, µi = 0; then we have ξi > 0. The corresponding data
contributes to the classifier, locating inside the margin
If ξi ≤ 1, then the data is still correctly classified, not crossing decision
boundary
If ξi > 1, then the data is incorrectly classified, crossing decision boundary

And we can derive the bias in the following way:

so in this project we tested varios slack varible from 0 to 1 step size 0.1

we get the following result:
we select slack variable 0.1 as example
```

```

## **SVM with non-linear kernel**
So in this part we set the slack variable to be 1, then we try to use kernels including: 2nd-order polynomial kernel, 3rd-order polynomial, rbf, sigmoid.

We use non-linear kernel because SVM can only handle linearly separable data, so we can add non-linearity to handle higher order polynomial data.

So we can formulate the SVM with kernel in the following manner:
![](https://i.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/03/06840ff7b5dae46b.png)

in the end we get the following result, take sigmoid as example:
